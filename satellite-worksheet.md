# Satellite Connector deployment considerations
{: #satellite-deployment-considerations}

Here are some deployment considerations to review when choosing Satellite Connector.
{: shortdesc}

| Deployment consideration | Action |
|----|-----|
| Do you need lightweight, secure tunnel or gateway from IBM Cloud back to your on-premises environment? If this describes your use case, see [Satellite Connector overview](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-understand-connectors). | |
| Still not sure which solution fits your use case? See more detailed [Satellite Location use cases](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-use-case) or the [Satellite Connector capability comparison with Secure Gateway](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-connector-and-secure-gateway#capability-comparison). | |
| Do you need to initiate communications from your on-premises to IBM Cloud? In this case, a Satellite Location is required instead of a Satellite Connector. | |
| Do you need to route networks between your on-premises and IBM Cloud? If so, consider a VPN or Direct Link connection. | |
| Do you also need to run IBM Cloud services like Red Hat OpenShift on your own infrastructure, another cloud provider infrastructure, or on the edge? If this describes your use case, see [Understanding Satellite locations and hosts](/docs/satellite?topic=satellite-location-host). | |
