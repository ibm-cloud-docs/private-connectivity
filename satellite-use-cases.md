# Satellite use cases
{: #use-cases-satellite}

* A Satellite Connector is a lightweight resource that provides secure TLS tunneling from IBM Cloud applications and services to your on-premises resources.

* A Satellite Location expands on a Satellite Connector's capabilities by adding the ability for cloud services to be delivered on-premises, such as a managed OpenShift on-premises or managed database on-premises. It also allows for communications originating from on-premises to resources inside of IBM Cloud.
