# Direct Link Dedicated use cases
{: #use-cases-direct-link-dedicated}

Primary use cases include transactional or batch data exchange across business-critical application workloads with high-volume and low-latency real-time access to software services and components across different clouds.

* Well-suited for continuous high volume real-time data transfers between applications e.g., system data replication
* Direct physical connection provides a robust, reliable, and fast communication to support multiple protocols and complex workload connectivity requirements.

For Direct Link Dedicated use cases, see [Customer on-premises facility to IBM Cloud](/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-about#use-cases-dedicated) and [Customer colocation to IBM Cloud](/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-about#use-case-dedicated-2).
