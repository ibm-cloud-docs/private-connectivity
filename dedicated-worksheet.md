# Direct Link Dedicated deployment considerations
{: #direct-link-dedicated-deployment-considerations}

Here are some deployment considerations to review when choosing Direct Link Dedicated.
{: shortdesc}

|   |   |
|:----|:--------|
| Set up a second, diverse direct link to prevent outages. [Learn more](/docs/dl?topic=dl-models-for-diversity-and-redundancy-in-direct-link) |  |
| Review Direct Link Dedicated [prerequisites](/docs/dl?topic=dl-ibm-cloud-dl-prerequisites). | |
| Consider whether you want a metered or unmetered pricing plan. Metered has a lower port fee and charges a per GB usage free for egress traffic across the direct link. Unmetered billing has a higher port fee and no usage charges, which is ideal for customers who have higher egress traffic across their direct link. | |
| Review Direct Link Dedicated [planning considerations](/docs/dl?topic=dl-how-to-order-ibm-cloud-dl-dedicated#before-you-begin-dedicated) and [planning for virtual connections](/docs/dl?topic=dl-dl-planning-considerations#dl-planning-virtual-connections). | |
| Review Direct Link Dedicated [known limitations](/docs/dl?topic=dl-known-limitations). |   |
| Decide what type of network connection that you want to bind to your direct link. For example, you can create a direct, private connection between your on-premises network and IBM Cloud, or bind your direct link to transit gateways. Your on-premises network can then access IBM Cloud resources connected through the transit gateways. [Learn more](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-about) | |
