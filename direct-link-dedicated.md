# Direct Link Dedicated
{: #reference-direct-link-dedicated}

This topic provides additional information on the Direct Link Dedicated offering.
{: shortdesc}

## Pricing
{: #reference-pricing-dedicated}

To calculate pricing for IBM Cloud offerings, use the [IBM Cloud cost estimator](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-calculator){: external}.
{: tip}

* High cost
* Dedicated connectivity with increased bandwidth options.
* Cost varies by network service provider.
* Costs are typically structured based on bandwidth limits, port charges (fixed or metered per GB of data), volume of data egress from VPC through the connection gateway, and so on.
* IBM Cloud offers two pricing plans - metered and unmetered. With metered pricing, you pay only for what you use. Unmetered means unlimited access, for a monthly fee.

## Connectivity
{: #reference-connectivity-dedicated}

* Connect the VPC networks directly with physical connections.
* The connection is established between the network provider and IBM Cloud at a co-location data center facility common to both parties.
* The connection is private, not encrypted, by-passes the internet, and is a dedicated single-tenant network connection.

## Latency and bandwidth
{: #reference-latency-bandwidth-dedicated}

* Lowest latency, single tenant, with high bandwidth options.
* Much higher maximum limits apply to throughput capacity, depending on the selected offerings from the network service provider.
* Available in speeds up to 10 Gbps.

## Provisioning
{: #reference-provisioning-dedicated}

* Requires the provisioning of physical connections at the colocation facility. This is done through a semi-self-service process with support and assistance from the network service provider and co-location facility partner.
* The provisioning process can take several days (typically 5 to 30), depending on the network service providerâ€™s co-location facility partner offerings, contracting process, and exchange of technical details to set up connectivity.
* Much lower flexibility to make changes and adapt to changes in workload locations due to physical connectivity, contracting and co-location dependencies.
* Detailed long-term planning is required, specific to workload location and connectivity service providers available at the colocation facility.
* IBM Cloud Direct Link Dedicated has partnerships with various co-location/data center operators.

## Security and data encryption
{: #reference-security-data-encryption-dedicated}

* Workload data transmitted across the network connections is usually not encrypted by the providers and is the customer's responsibility.
* Encryption is highly recommended and can be achieved at application level, for example with TLS encryption between the application client/severs.
* Optionally, VPN can be set up on the connection to get a secure tunnel between endpoint sub-networks.
* The offering configuration and control data is encrypted in-transit and at-rest at the database level.  [Learn more](/docs/dl?topic=dl-mng-data#data-storage)

## Resiliency
{: #reference-resiliency-dedicated}

* Depends on the availability requirements. Additional connections can be provisioned in same or different PoPs (Points of Presence) to achieve higher resiliency.
* Optionally, for a lower-cost redundant alternative, a VPN or partner network connectivity can be provisioned and used as fallback.

## Monitoring and logging
{: #reference-monitoring-logging-dedicated}

Direct Link Dedicated uses a combination of IBM Activity Tracker and the IBM Cloud Console for log analysis and metrics monitoring.

### Direct Link Dedicated log analysis
{: #dld-logging}

You can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact with Direct Link Dedicated in IBM Cloud.

IBM Cloud Activity Tracker records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, refer to [Auditing events for IBM Cloud Direct Link](/docs/dl?topic=dl-at_events&interface=ui).

### Direct Link Dedicated metrics monitoring
{: #dld-metrics}

You can generate a report of all routes known to a direct link and its connections. This report allows you to verify the expected routes, view what virtual connections are contributing which routes to your direct link, and see next-hop address details of the routes received. If using the cross-account VPC linking feature, you can also see which prefixes or subnets are being routed through your cross-connect router. For more information, refer to [Generating a direct link route report](/docs/dl?topic=dl-generate-route-reports&interface=ui).
